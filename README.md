## Description about the project
The DIVA model integrated into Clarion using the pyClarion library. Tested on the 6 elemental categories created from inputs of three binary features.
​
## Instructions
 * Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 * How do you access it? For example: Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described in the previous section.
 * This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully.
 
 ## Development requirements
  * Programming Languages: Python
  * Software Dependencies: python 3.12, pip
  * Librarys: [Pyclarion branch v2409](https://github.com/cmekik/pyClarion/tree/v2409)
    
 ## Installation
 in the terminal, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
 then follow the instructions on the pyClarion repository to install pyClarion. After, simply run main.py using the command `python main.py` in the terminal. This will create a new set of graphs within the graphs and focus_graphs repositories as well as new averages.cvc and focus_averages.cvc documenting the Mean error rate for each epoch.
